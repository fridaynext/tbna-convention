work originally done in January 2017.

In this project, after the designer created an SVG with all the available booths / tables to rent at this convention, I used `regex` to go through and create unique HTML IDs/classes for each booth, so that I could connect them to their respective product listings in a WooCommerce database. I linked the map to the stock status from WooCommerce, so that the unit availability was visible right from the main map.

This also enabled easy custom SVG product images for each product, using the active product page's ID to highlight the booth or table in question.
